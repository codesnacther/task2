Task 2 – SQL Developer Internship

About the Task  
This was a simple SQL task where I had to insert, update, and delete data in a table. I made an `employees` table and played around with some sample data to practice.

What I Did  
- Made a basic table with fields like name, age, department, salary  
- Inserted some rows (with and without nulls)  
- Updated a couple of rows using conditions  
- Deleted one row and tried rollback too  

Why It Matters  
It’s useful to know how to handle data in SQL — especially when dealing with real-life messy data. This helped me understand how to work with missing values and default values too.
